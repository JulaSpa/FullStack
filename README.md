# FullStack
This is an example of a full-stack app, where you can do the CRUD functions in the react frontend, and these functions will affect the Mongo DB database in Atlas
(ask me for the dotenv file).

# Funcionalities
The idea of this application is to manage the members of a pretended "project" and add, modify, or delete their employees. In the same way, you can do these functions
on the employees.
